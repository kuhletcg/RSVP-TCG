# RSVP-TCG
 
## Introduction
 
 This is where you will find the confirmation of the requirements that we were asked to do to this activity.

## Instructions

Write a Reactjs TCG RSVP App. It should let you view a list of TCG events ordered by Event DateTime and have a button to RSVP to a specific event. After clicking on the RSVP button, a modal dialog should be loaded allowing a student to capture their details (Name Surname, Email address, Dietary Requirements). RSVPs must save to the MongoDB instance. Separate your front-end from your API code and I should be able to run your API and front-end separately. 

## Solutions

I have created a form whereby people will able to fill up their personal information. After that, they is a button to click to submit to a certain event. The information will be saved on MongoDB.

MongoDB is a general-purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. 
You can run an API using insomnia or postman.
